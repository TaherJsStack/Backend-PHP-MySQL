			Meanwhile, Tom Jenkins, chief executive of the European Tourism Association, said the public were rationalising the spate of attacks, realising they could happen anywhere.

			He said: “The nature of free and open societies is people are vulnerable at any stage. It’s perfectly easy for anyone to grab an axe and start swinging.

			“Terror used to be a major and sensational disruption to the travel industry. In the 1980s and early 1990s we saw mass cancellations, a real failure of nerve on an epic scale.”

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>

				“These robust results, the best we have seen in many years, reflect the sustained demand for travel around the world, in line with the improved global economy and the rebound of destinations that suffered declines in previous years,” said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai…

				UNWTO World Tourism Barometer
				14 December 2017

				Destinations around the world welcomed 1.1 billion international tourists between January and October 2017, according to the latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer. This represents a 7% increase on the same period of last year, or 70 million more international arrivals. Strong demand for international tourism across world regions reflects the global economic upswing.
				
				Hooray! The Brexit UK is saved! (according to the Brexiters' comments below)

				To put things into some perspective – 2017 is a good year for world tourism due to economic recovery. In Europe, international tourist arrivals are up by 8%. So the UK’s tourism growth is about average in the European context – nothing exceptional (in particular when one considers low BrexGBP). In Southern Europe, growth is 13%.
